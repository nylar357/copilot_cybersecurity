By combining AI-driven insights with human expertise, learners gain practical skills to detect, investigate, and respond to threats more effectively.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
By the end of this course, you will be able to:
- Understand the role of **generative AI** in modern cybersecurity operations.
- Apply **Copilot for Security** to analyze and interpret complex security logs.
- Automate repetitive tasks such as **log parsing, anomaly detection, and summarization**.
- Enhance **threat detection and incident response** with AI-assisted workflows.
- Evaluate the **strengths and limitations** of AI in cybersecurity contexts.

## 🛠️ Key Topics Covered
- Introduction to **Copilot for Security** and its integration into SOC workflows.
- Using **natural language prompts** to query and analyze log data.
- Identifying **patterns, anomalies, and potential threats** in large datasets.
- Case studies on **real-world security incidents** and AI-assisted investigations.
- Ethical considerations and **responsible AI usage** in cybersecurity.

## 📂 Sample Prompts : # 

🧑‍💻 Example Prompts for Copilot in Cybersecurity Log Analysis

These prompts are designed to help you experiment with **Copilot for Security** (or other generative AI tools) when analyzing logs.  
You can adapt them to your own environment, log formats, and security use cases.

## 🔍 Log Parsing & Summarization
- *"Summarize the key events in this Windows Event Log snippet and highlight any unusual activity."*
- *"Parse this Apache access log and identify the top 5 IP addresses by request volume."*
- *"From this firewall log, extract all denied connections and group them by source IP."*

---

## 🚨 Threat Detection
- *"Analyze this log for signs of brute-force login attempts. Provide evidence and reasoning."*
- *"Identify any suspicious PowerShell commands in this log snippet and explain why they may be risky."*
- *"Look for indicators of lateral movement in these authentication logs."*

---

## 📊 Pattern Recognition
- *"Detect anomalies in this 24-hour log dataset. Which events deviate most from the baseline?"*
- *"Group these log entries by user account and summarize their activity patterns."*
- *"Identify repeated failed login attempts followed by a successful login from the same IP."*

---

## 🛡️ Incident Response Support
- *"Generate a timeline of events from this log to support an incident investigation."*
- *"Correlate these IDS alerts with firewall logs to determine if the attack was successful."*
- *"Provide a plain-language summary of this log data for a non-technical executive report."*

---

## ⚖️ Responsible AI Use
- *"Explain the limitations of using AI for detecting threats in this log sample."*
- *"Highlight where human analyst review is still required after this AI-assisted analysis."*

💡 **Tip:** When using these prompts, always:
- Provide **context** (e.g., type of log, timeframe, suspected issue).
- Ask for **explanations**, not just answers, to understand the AI’s reasoning.
- Validate AI findings with your own expertise and other tools.
