📘 Copilot for Cybersecurity: Leveraging Generative AI for Security Log Analysis
This lecture from the Copilot for Cybersecurity course explores how generative AI can transform traditional security operations by automating and enhancing log analysis. It focuses on using Microsoft Copilot to interpret complex log data, identify threats, and accelerate incident response.

🎯 Course Objective
Learn how to use generative AI to:

Analyze and summarize security logs

Detect anomalies and suspicious behavior

Extract indicators of compromise (IOCs)

Automate threat detection and reporting

🧠 What You’ll Learn
🔍 Log Analysis with Copilot
Upload logs from sources like Syslog, Windows Event Viewer, Apache, or cloud platforms

Ask natural language questions such as:

“Are there any failed login attempts?”

“Summarize unusual activity in this log”

Copilot parses and highlights relevant entries, saving hours of manual review

⚠️ Threat Detection & IOC Extraction
Copilot identifies:

Malicious IP addresses

Suspicious file hashes

Unusual login patterns

It can correlate events across multiple logs to detect lateral movement or privilege escalation

🛠️ Automation & Rule Generation
Generate Sigma or YARA rules based on observed behavior

Translate threat reports into actionable detection logic

Automate triage and response workflows using AI-generated summaries

🧩 Integration Scenarios
Tool/Platform	Use Case
Microsoft Sentinel	Analyze alerts and logs with Copilot
Defender for Endpoint	Investigate endpoint telemetry
GitHub Security	Review code for vulnerabilities
Threat Intelligence	Summarize CVEs and map to MITRE ATT&CK
📂 Supported Log Formats
.log, .evtx, .json, .csv

Cloud-native logs (Azure, AWS, GCP)

SIEM exports

🧪 Sample Prompts
bash
> Upload: apache_access.log
> Prompt: "Find any suspicious requests or IPs in this log file."

> Upload: windows_events.evtx
> Prompt: "Summarize failed login attempts and possible brute-force indicators."
